    <h3>Baseball</h3>
    <p>When I was kid, I often watched the baseball through Television at home. But at that time, I didn't understand the rule of baseball. So I felt it's very boring. But when I was a high school student, I learned the rule. And then, I played baseball game of smart phone and watched baseball. I felt something different. The baseabll is very fun! and exciting! After that, I was playing and watching more and more. I still like a baseball. Actually I will go to the Wigley Field on September 10th!!</p>
    <p>My favorite baseball team is Lotte Giants in Korea and LA Dodgers in US. Because my family is fan of Lotte Giants. So I became a fan naturally. And I like Hyun-Jin Ryu in LA Dodgers.</p>
